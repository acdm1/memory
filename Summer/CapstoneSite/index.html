            <h2>A Sonic Dérive: Drifting Parks’ Soundscapes to consider Psychogeography as a Frame for Urban Studies Field-Work</h2>
            <h3 class="h3">
              Soundscapes are an area of urban consideration that have more often than not been utilized to connect the audio characteristics of a particular locality to musical compositions through computational means, providing a plethora of paths to artistic guidance and inspiration. The capturing of soundscapes and relating them explicitly to geographically tagged locations isn’t a revolutionary practice by any means, but the value such practices hold to research and science are difficult for some to tease out, because of the subjective nature of the sound capturing process itself. This psychogeographic-exercise of gathering soundscapes, attempts to glue back together a couple of sciences that correctly used humans as instruments for learning about the environment too. By attempting to utilize subjective observations and data collection methods alongside modern sound collection practices, to consider not just the soundscapes themselves but also the value to be found between and beyond the ambience of parks, critical urban designers begin to find ways of communicating beyond the academic realm, while still contributing value to scientifically based social sciences in meaningful ways.

            <h3>All sounds were collected between the hours of 1800 and 2100, over the span of one weekend (Fri-Sun) during the month of July. After the area had just experienced a heat wave, weather conditions were mild with partly cloudy skies, and a breeze can occasionally be heard on many of the recordings.<br><br>The equipment utilized during the field work exercise is centered around the functionality of the TASCAM™ DR-701D Linear PCM Recorder, a six-track field recorder most commonly appearing in film and video setups. Two of the 6 feeds for taking in audio were used, with 2 basic Shure™ dynamic microphones being attached via 2 six-foot long cables; so this was one mic each for capturing both left and right-side audio tracks to produce what are known as “binaural recordings” (Aletta et al. 2019).<br><br>A Fuji-Film X70 Camera was employed for capturing images while at the 7 park locations, chosen for their proximity and access to the waters of the Puget Sound. This project produced approximately 100 images, stored for their potential use on the website and map. And similar to the experiences of Pyyry (2019) the feeling remains that “the photographs produced [during this field work, could] not [be] discarded as useless.<br><br>The challenge though [by the strictly objective observer] is the priority of them as the means of sense-making or as evidence of a world that once was” (320). This is where the ability to display research materials in an open-source format becomes incredibly useful though.</h3>
